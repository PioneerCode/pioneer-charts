          <p class="lead">Charts in the Pioneer Charts library utilize a shared based configuration for simplicity and familiarization.</p>
          <p>The base interface for all configuration of a chart is centered around the idea that raw data, no matter how complex,
            can always be expressed as a multi-dimensional array.</p>

          <!-- <pc-prism language="typescript" [code]="data"></pc-prism> -->
          <p>When a configuration interface is created for a chart, it starts off with a representation of raw data.
            <b>data: IPcacData[];</b> represent the base of our multi-dimensional array that we discussed above.
          </p>

          <p>A lot of charts inside the Pioneer Charts library share basic configuration parameters. Of which are represented
            in this interface. We account for these shared parameters in this interface, of which has a property of the type
            <b>IPcacData[]</b>.

          <h3 id="new-chart-config">New Chart Config</h3>
          <p>Now that we have an interface that effectively represent shared aspects of most charts and defines a repeatable
            and familiar contract to represent raw data, we are in a position to make chart specif configuration. Each chart
            in the Pioneer Chart library typically extends
            <b>IPcacChartConfig</b> to set a bases for configuration and provides additional chart specific configuration alongside
            of it. For example, in the case of a bar chart, the configure looks similar to the following.</p>
          <!-- <pc-prism language="typescript" [code]="barChartConfig"></pc-prism> -->

        <section class="pc-doc-section">
          <h3 id="map">Binding Configuration</h3>
          <p>When adding a chart to your markup, you will typically bind your data and configuration on the
            <b>[config]</b> input of that chart.</p>
          <!-- <pc-prism language="html" [code]="bindConfig"></pc-prism> -->
          <p>To strongly type your config, you typically want to supply the specific charts config interface as the typing.</p>
