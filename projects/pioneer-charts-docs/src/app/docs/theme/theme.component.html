    <h3 id="default-theme">Default Theme</h3>
    <p>A compiled version of the default theme is located at the following:</p>
    <pre class="app-layout-code">./node_modules/&#64;pioneer-code/pioneer-charts/
  |-  dist/styles
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.css
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.css.map
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.min.css
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.min.css.map</pre>
  </section>
  <section class="pc-doc-section">
    <h3 id="sass">Sass</h3>
    <p>If you prefer adding the default theme to your project through a Sass build, you need to make reference to the
      root Pioneer Chart Sass file in your project like so.</p>
    <app-layout-code language="typescript" [code]="importStylesCode"></app-layout-code>
  </section>
  <section class="pc-doc-section">
    <h3 id="customize">Customize</h3>
    <p>Styling for Pioneer Charts takes place at two different levels. The first being css and the second being through
      code. The need to do align styling across css and javascript comes from the dynamic nature styles are applied
      through
      <a href="https://d3js.org/" title="D3">D3</a>.
    </p>
    <h5 id="styles">Styles</h5>
    <p>Much like before, you are going to want to import the Pioneer Chart Sass code into your code. The difference
      being,
      you will now want to override Pioneer Chart variables at the same time.</p>
    <app-layout-code language="typescript" [code]="importStylesCodeOverride"></app-layout-code>
    <p>For a full reference of variables, you can look at the default theme import file locate at the following:</p>
    <pre
      class="app-layout-code">./node_modules/&#64;pioneer-code/pioneer-charts/src/styles/core/theme/imports.scss</pre>
    <h5 id="color-service">Color Service</h5>
    <p>In some cases, the charts that utilize d3 apply styles dynamically. For example, in a bar chart, a d3 iteration
      over a collection of data that produces individual bars in the chart might require each bar to be a different
      color. Meaning, in that piece of code that colors are being applied from the color service.</p>
    <app-layout-code language="typescript" [code]="colorServiceExample"></app-layout-code>
    <p>In order to override these values in your code, you will first need to import the
      <b>PcacColorService</b> into your
      <b>App Component</b>.
    </p>
    <app-layout-code language="typescript" [code]="importColorService"></app-layout-code>
    <p>Now that you have access to the colorService, you can start interacting with its API directly in
      <b>ngOnInit</b>.
    </p>
    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 30%">Call</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>setScale(colors: string[])</td>
          <td>Supply n-number of hex color values. These values will be applied to charts that require dynamic coloring.
            If the supplied length is less then the number of data iterations in the chart, the coloring will circle
            back to the start of the color collection. Typically you want this to correspond with the
            <b>theme-colors(...)</b> Sass variable.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
